        "summary": "The responses from Wall Street to the recent announcements from Apple's annual fall product event were largely \"as expected.\" The new hardware product releases were seen as evolutionary rather than revolutionary, with the features being generally in line with forecasted predictions. Notable surprises included the inclusion of sleep apnea detection for the Apple Watch and hearing aid functionality for AirPod Pros. However, the rollout of AI was considered slow and underwhelming. Analysts expect aggressive marketing of AI functionality, but predict that consumer upgrades could be delayed until later this year or iPhone 17. A cautious rollout of AI is seen to be beneficial for Apple in the long run and it's expected to drive a \"renaissance of iPhone growth.\" Consequently, Apple shares fell by 1% in pre-market trading on Tuesday.\n"
